# penpot plugins samples

In this repository, you'll find a few practical examples and use cases. These examples can help you get started with your first plugin.

For each example, we used the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/penpot/penpot-plugin-starter-template">starter template repository</a> that you can use as a starting point.

Feel free to explore the examples, modify the code, and experiment with different approaches. We want you to understand these examples so you can apply them confidently in your own development work.

## Getting Started ##
These plugins are written in TypeScript. TypeScript is like JavaScript's supercharged sibling, helping to catch errors early and make your code cleaner and easier to work with. It's great for keeping things organized and bug-free. It allows us to use our type library, which gives the user the benefits of autocompletion and error checking. These make coding smoother, more reliable, and just a lot nicer to work with.
